README for Gutachter
====================

Gutachter is a graphical user interface to unit test execution. You can
compare it to the JUnit runner if you are familiar with that one.

Gutachter makes it easy for you to use it. Just open a testcase binary and
see how the tester loads the information about the tests. Click "Execute" and
see how the tests are being executed.
